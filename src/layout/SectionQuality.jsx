            Although we work with growers who pay close attention to all stages
            of harvest and processing, we employ, on our end, a rigorous quality
            control program to avoid over-roasting or baking the coffee dry.
            Every bag of coffee is tagged with a roast date and batch number.
            Our goal is to roast consistent, user-friendly coffee, so that
            brewing is easy and enjoyable.
